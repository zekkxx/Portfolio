            <p>Hello! My name is Kieran Anthony, I tend to code under the moniker zekkxx, which has been my email since I was seven. I think I made it to play Neopets or something like that in elementary school. So I'm rather attached to it. I'm a new developer working on getting involved with the industry and currently am enrolled in the <a target="_blank" href="https://bootcamp.umn.edu/">University of Minnesota Full Stack Developer Bootcamp</a>. Just like the name begets, I'm interested in both front-end and back-end development. I have a bit more experience with backend applications simply because of my schooling, but I'm planning on making sure that I have the proper experience with front-end design too.</p>
            <p>I'm a Minnesota native, and I currently live in Bloomington, not too far from Thomas Jefferson Senior High School. I'm looking for jobs in the Twin Cities, but I'm not against travelling outside of my hometown. I actually spent 4 years in Indiana attending Ball State University so I'm willing to go just about anywhere.</p>
            <p>In my spare time, I work on independant projects like my homebrew version of <a target="_blank" class="hiddenLink" href="http://dnd.wizards.com/"><em>Dungeons & Dragons</em></a> that I call <em>Saerie</em>. I also like to play video games and am an amateur game developer as well. I am part of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.igdatc.org/">Twin Cities IGDA</a> in respect to that. I also like to swim, and I enjoy long walks in the park and on the beach.</p>
