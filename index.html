            <p>Hello! My name is Kieran Anthony. I am a developer who is currently getting involved with the software development industry and am currently enrolled in the <a target="_blank" href="https://bootcamp.umn.edu/">University of Minnesota Full Stack Developer Bootcamp</a>. Just like the name begets, I'm interested in both front-end and back-end development.</p>
            <p>I'm a Minnesota native, and I currently live in central Bloomington. I'm looking for jobs in and around the Twin Cities, but I'm keeping an open mind to any opportunity. I spent four years in Indiana attending, and graduating from, Ball State University and have worked on maintaining a group of friends across the United States.</p>
            <p>In my spare time, I work on independant projects including a TTRPG based on <a target="_blank" class="hiddenLink" href="http://dnd.wizards.com/"><em>Dungeons & Dragons</em></a> called <em>Saerie</em>. I also enjoy video games and am an part of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.igdatc.org/">Twin Cities IGDA</a> as an amateur game developer. I also enjoy swimming, frisbee golf, watching movies, and writing.</p>
            <p>User-Oriented Web Developer with a passion for providing a sleek and error-free user experience. Experienced and skilled with code-refinement, error prevention, and providing a smooth experience for all users on all platforms. Currently specializing on the programming experience gained from Ball State University with the University of Minnesota Coding Bootcamp for Full-Stack developers, and looking to apply this knowledge to continue refining, innovating and building web systems through ongoing collaboration with other developers.</p>
